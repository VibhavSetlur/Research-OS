# Protocol Reference

Research OS ships **113 YAML protocols** organised into nine categories.
Each protocol is a sequence of steps the AI should follow, with explicit
`expected_outputs`, a `next_protocol` pointer, and a `quality_bar`. All
are indexed in `src/research_os/protocols/_router_index.yaml` for
hierarchical routing via `tool_route`.

| Category | Count | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| `methodology/` | 42 | Method pickers + per-family deep workflows (causal, ML, Bayesian, time-series, clinical, qualitative, mixed-methods, simulation, replication, ablation, pilot, evaluation design, hyperparameter sweep design, ethics review, EDA + hypothesis generation, method comparison, data-quality audit, power analysis, reproduction, methodological consultation). **v1.4.0** adds `pick_tool_stack` (R vs Python per sub-task, field-practice grounded) and `mixed_language_orchestration` (Python↔R↔Bash composition doctrine). |
| `guidance/` | 19 | Session boot / resume / handoff / autopilot / collaboration, intake, iterative planning, dead-end routing, hypothesis + glossary tracking, mid-pipeline entry, code review, peer-review response, **scope-clarification**. |
| `synthesis/` | 17 | Paper, abstract, poster, dashboard, grant, report, slides, lay summary, progress update, cover letter, title workshop, handout, null-findings companion, synthesis-from-inputs. |
| `visualization/` | 14 | Figure guidelines, viz workflow, single-figure critique, multi-panel composition, narrative arc, colour-accessibility audit, interactive figure design. |
| `writing/` | 10 | Per-section drafting (methods / results / discussion / limitations / end-matter), writing core rules, citations ledger, conclusions, analysis log, README. |
| `literature/` | 5 | Search, systematic review (PRISMA), evidence synthesis (GRADE), comparative paper review. **v1.4.0** adds `literature_per_step` — per-step search → download → cite → write `findings_vs_literature.md` (AGREES \| DISAGREES \| EXTENDS \| DEFERRED). |
| `audit/` | 3 | Master audit + validation, pre-submission checklist, provenance completeness. |
| `domain/` | 2 | Domain classification, research-design + sample-size justification. |
| `reproducibility/` | 1 | Per-step env lock, seed verification, container generation. |
| **Total** | **113** | |

The protocol surface deliberately covers BOTH the canonical
data → publication pipeline AND the partial / off-axis workflows
real researchers actually run: visualization-only requests, talk decks,
lay summaries for non-experts, PI progress updates, exploratory data
analysis with hypothesis generation, head-to-head method comparisons,
standalone power analyses, reproduction attempts of published work,
teaching / consultation modes, multi-paper comparative reviews,
mid-pipeline entry, per-section paper drafting (results / discussion /
limitations / end-matter), multi-panel figure composition, figure
narrative arcs, color accessibility audits, cover letters, title
workshops, printable handouts, evaluation + sweep design, and data
ethics review. See [USE_CASES.md](USE_CASES.md) for a role × goal map
of when each protocol fires.

## How the AI picks a protocol (the hierarchical router)

The AI does **not** load every YAML to find the right one. The AI only
ever acts AFTER a researcher message arrives; on the first turn of a
session it fires these two calls back-to-back:

1. **`sys_boot`** — FIRST MCP call (first turn only). Returns workspace
   state + recommended pipeline-next protocol + advice.
2. **`tool_route(prompt=<researcher's verbatim message>)`** — SECOND
   MCP call. Hierarchical L1 → L2 → L3 picker. Returns the deepest
   unambiguous level:
   * L1 `intent_class` — one of `session | discover | plan | execute |
     methodology | literature | synthesize | audit_wrap | memory |
     review`
   * L2 `sub_intent` — narrower bucket within the class
   * L3 specific protocol
   When ambiguous at any level, the router returns an `ask_user`
   sentence so the AI disambiguates with one researcher follow-up
   instead of guessing wrong.
3. **`sys_protocol_get format='summary'`** loads step headings only
   (~300 tokens). `format='step' step_id='<id>'` loads one step body
   when ready to execute.

This entire path costs ~1.2K tokens — vs the ~5K it took before the
routing layer existed.

## The main pipeline (10 stages, in order)

| # | Protocol | What it does | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `guidance/session_boot` | One-call boot via `sys_boot`; route first message via `tool_route` | first entry in execution log |
| 2 | `guidance/project_startup` | Intake autofill, profile data, lock research question | intake.md filled + research_overview.md confirmed |
| 3 | `domain/domain_analysis` | Classify domain, pick reporting standard, list biases | docs/domain_summary.md exists |
| 4 | `domain/research_design` | Choose study design + sample size justification | docs/research_design.md exists |
| 5 | `methodology/methodology_selection` | Pick statistical / computational methods (literature-grounded) | workspace/methods.md substantive |
| 6 | `literature/literature_search` | Multi-database search + dedup + PRISMA accounting | literature_index.yaml + citations.md exist |
| 7 | `guidance/analysis_plan` | Per-step loop: scope → ground → execute → document → snapshot | ≥1 experiment with non-empty conclusions.md |
| 8 | `reproducibility/reproducibility` | Lock environments, verify seeds, generate Dockerfile | per-experiment requirements.txt exist |
| 9 | `audit/audit_and_validation` | Citation / power / assumption / figure / code audits | workspace/logs/audit_report.md exists |
| 10 | `synthesis/synthesis_paper` | Compile paper (venue-tailored, verified citations) | synthesis/paper.md exists |

`sys_protocol_next` returns the first stage whose outputs (or execution
log) say "not done yet". The pipeline works off both the execution log
AND on-disk artifacts so migrated projects resume cleanly.

### Synthesis — final deliverables

Each is venue/audience-tailored and enforces quality minimums:

* `synthesis/synthesis_paper` — IMRAD, venue profiles
  (journal / conference / preprint / dissertation / report). Word-count
  bands, figure DPI ≥300, citation cap 40, verified online.
* `synthesis/synthesis_abstract` — structured (journal/preprint) vs
  unstructured (conference) vs grant style. Cap 3 citations.
* `synthesis/synthesis_poster` — tikzposter, billboard mode (Morrison
  Better Poster) + classic IMRAD. Audience profiles (academic_conference
  / symposium / industry / teaching). ≥2 figures ≥300 DPI, ≤6 citations.
* `synthesis/synthesis_dashboard` — single-file HTML, audience profiles
  (academic / executive / technical / teaching). Sortable tables,
  lightbox, light/dark, print stylesheet, evidence-traceability matrix,
  outstanding-artefacts panel.
* `synthesis/synthesis_null_findings` — publishable companion for
  refuted / inconclusive / underpowered / abandoned findings — fights
  the file-drawer problem.
* `synthesis/synthesis_grant` — funder profiles
  (nih_r01 / nsf / wellcome / erc / doe / industry). Specific Aims first.
* `synthesis/synthesis_report` — audience profiles
  (internal_team / client / technical_audit / policy_brief).
* `synthesis/synthesis_slides` — presentation deck (lab meeting /
  conference short / conference long / defense / invited seminar /
  teaching). Beamer / Marp / Reveal.js / PowerPoint output. Speaker
  notes + Q&A anticipation are part of the deliverable.
* `synthesis/synthesis_lay_summary` — non-expert summary
  (general_public / press_release / funder_lay_section /
  patient_or_participant / social_thread / blog_post). Reading-grade
  capped; jargon replaced; numbers anchored.
* `synthesis/synthesis_progress_update` — short PI / advisor / lab /
  stand-up update. Sourced from the diff since the last update;
  blockers + ask explicit.
* `synthesis/synthesis_from_inputs` — synthesis when prior analyses
  were done OUTSIDE Research-OS. Builds a shadow workspace step,
  imports the artefacts, runs the chosen target synthesis on top,
  with a provenance ceiling stated in the final deliverable.
* `synthesis/synthesis_cover_letter` — journal cover letter (fit +
  significance + reviewers + disclosures + word cap ≤ 400).
* `synthesis/synthesis_title_workshop` — title generation + iteration
  (≥6 alternatives across archetypes, substring test, shortlist of 3,
  stress test the winner).
* `synthesis/synthesis_handout` — single-page printable leave-behind /
  one-pager (5 audience profiles, QR code mandatory).

### Audit + reproducibility

* `audit/audit_and_validation` — master quality audit
  (`tool_audit_quality_full`): step completeness, code quality, prose
  quality, claim grounding, pre-registration diff, grounding
  verification. Single call, every gate. Aggregates to
  `workspace/logs/audit_master.md`.
* `reproducibility/reproducibility` — per-step env snapshot, seed
  verification, output hashing, Apptainer + Dockerfile + entrypoint
  generation.

### Visualization

* `visualization/figure_guidelines` — chart-chooser + formatting standards
  (palettes, fonts, DPI, error indicators). The style-and-rules
  reference.
* `visualization/visualization_workflow` — build / polish a figure or
  figure deck WITHOUT committing to the full analysis_plan loop. The
  workflow counterpart of figure_guidelines.
* `visualization/figure_critique` — reviewer-style critique of a
  single figure (chart family, encoding, caption alignment,
  sensitivity to alternative encoding).
* `visualization/multi_panel_composition` — compose a multi-panel
  figure (Figure 2 = A / B / C / D) with shared scales + combined
  caption.
* `visualization/figure_narrative_arc` — order figures across a paper /
  talk / poster (figure budget + arc + cut decisions + reading-order
  sanity check).
* `visualization/color_accessibility_audit` — color-blindness
  simulation (3 types) + WCAG contrast + grayscale-survivability +
  redundant-encoding audit.

## Cross-intent shortcuts (no protocol load, single tool call)

`tool_route` also matches cross-cutting intents that don't need a
protocol:

| Trigger | Tool called |
|---|---|
| "progress", "where are we", "digest" | `tool_progress_digest` |
| "lessons", "what did we learn" | `tool_dead_end_lessons` |
| "list protocols", "available protocols" | `sys_protocol_list` |
| "missing dependencies", "what's installed" | `sys_dep_inventory` |
| "broken", "fix workspace" | `tool_workspace_repair` |
| "background", "kick off", "going to lunch" | `tool_task_run` |
| "quick test", "scratch", "throwaway" | `tool_scratch_write` |

---

## Anti-one-shot: the active plan + per-turn batching

When `tool_route` detects a complex prompt (>25 words OR multiple verbs
OR conjunctions like "and then" / "also"), it persists a planning
record to `.os_state/active_plan.json` and returns `complexity="high"`.
The AI MUST walk the plan instead of one-shotting:

* `tool_plan_turn` — returns `this_turn` (steps to execute now) +
  `next_turn` (queued), sized to the researcher's `model_profile`
  (small=1 step/turn, medium=3, large=6; heavy tools like
  `tool_synthesize` count for more).
* `tool_plan_advance` — after each step completes.
* `tool_plan_clear` — if the researcher pivots mid-plan.

When `chat_split_recommended=true` (long plan remaining), the AI hands
off + asks the researcher to open a fresh chat with "pick up where we
left off". `tool_session_resume` will read the handoff and active plan.

---

## Quality minimums

Every protocol declares a `quality_bar` block. Examples:

* `synthesis_paper`: abstract 200-300 words, methods ≥400 words, ≥1
  figure, ≥8 citations, every claim grounded, no causal language for
  observational designs.
* `synthesis_poster`: ≥2 figures ≥300 DPI, ≤6 citations, font ≥24pt,
  one headline message.
* `synthesis_dashboard`: single-file offline HTML, semantic landmarks,
  print-friendly, ≤12 citations, ≥3 sections.
* `synthesis_grant`: Specific Aims ≤500 words (1 page), Approach
  ≥1500 words, every Aim has milestones + pitfalls + alternatives,
  ≥15 citations.
* `methodology/qualitative_research`: every theme ≥2 quotes from ≥2
  participants; at least one disconfirming case reported; codebook
  reproducible by a second coder; reflexivity statement explicit.
* `methodology/replication_study`: replication criterion declared
  BEFORE looking at the new estimate; verdict supported by both
  criterion + sensitivity around original spec.
* `methodology/simulation_studies`: ADEMP written BEFORE code runs;
  Monte Carlo SE reported with every point estimate; sensitivity rerun
  confirms headline.

The AI is instructed to refuse to mark a synthesis complete until the
quality bar passes.

---

## How `model_profile` affects protocols

When the protocol loader reads a YAML, it applies the researcher's
`model_profile`:

* `small` — drops verbose keys (`model_adaptations`, `examples`,
  `templates`) to keep tokens minimal. AI tool descriptions are also
  trimmed.
* `medium` — standard (default).
* `large` — full detail; protocols may suggest multi-step planning.

`tool_plan_turn` also reads `model_profile` to size per-turn batches.
A researcher on a small local model gets 1 tool call per turn; a large
frontier model gets 6.

---

## Adding a new protocol

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the schema. Two
mandatory follow-ups:

1. Add an entry to `_router_index.yaml` with `intent_class`,
   `sub_intent`, `summary`, `triggers` (plus optional `shortcut_tool`,
   `token_estimate`, `decomposition`). Preflight will fail if you
   forget.
2. Add a test in `tests/tools/test_router.py` for a triggering prompt
   to verify the router picks your protocol.

The loader auto-injects a `protocol_completion` step — don't add one
yourself.
